# devnull

For testing it is sometimes of interest to have a web service which returns OK for anything that is passed to it much like the null device in Unix. In Unix you can open open the `/dev/null` device and write to it. It is an empty file that accepts all data written to it without storing the data.

For a web service to act in a similar fashion it would run and accept anything passed as a parameter in urls passed to it.

Example program from the following post.
